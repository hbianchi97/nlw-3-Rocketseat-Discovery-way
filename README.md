The best event in brazil to study about it

I think that it's the best experience i've ever had about it.
I could got a lot of knowledge about how to build HTML structure, how to apply a certain kind of display and position to organize my page in my own way.
I can learn the logic besides back-end, about make interaction and receive data.
And it's my first time with database. I could got how it works and how i can receive, manage and organize many kinds of data.

I can't describle how thankfull i am to rocketseat to give us that amazing knowledge about what we most like, code <3
